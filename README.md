## üì• Installation

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  s3_storage:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/halifox/dart_s3_storage
      ref: 1.0.7
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```dart
final s3_storage = S3Storage(
  endPoint: 's3.amazonaws.com',  // or '${Account_ID}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com'
  accessKey: 'Access Key ID',
  secretKey: 'Secret Access Key',
  signingType: SigningType.V4, // or SigningType.V2
);
```

**Upload an object to the bucket**

```dart
  String etag = await s3_storage.fPutObject('mybucket', 'myobject', 'path/to/file');
```

**Upload an object as a stream**

```dart
  String etag = await s3_storage.putObject(
    'mybucket',
    'myobject',
    Stream<Uint8List>.value(Uint8List(1024)),
    onProgress: (bytes) => print('$bytes uploaded'),
  );
```

**Retrieve an object from the bucket**

```dart
  final stream = await s3_storage.getObject('BUCKET-NAME', 'OBJECT-NAME');

  // Get object length
  print(stream.contentLength);

  // Write object data stream to a file
  await stream.pipe(File('output.txt').openWrite());
```
